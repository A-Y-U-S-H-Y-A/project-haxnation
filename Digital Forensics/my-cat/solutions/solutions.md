We can upload the image on an image EXIF data (metadata) analyser such as [Metadata2Go](https://www.metadata2go.com/)<br />
You would see a comment in the image metadata (object_name IMEI: 860607062388146)  <br />
We can input the IMEI to an IMEI Information finding website such as [IMEI INFO](https://www.imei.info/)<br />
The website would give us the model of the phone along with the brand (VIVO Y16). This can be used to solve the challenge (Y16) <br />
