# Sunday Blues
To solve the challenge set before, <br />
Through shades of blue, we must explore. <br />
A world unseen by red or green, <br />
Where clues in black can still be gleaned. <br />
<br />
With eyes on blue alone we gaze,<br />
To search the dark in hidden ways.<br />
The blackened spots, a mystery hold,<br />
Their silent whispers, truths untold.<br />
<br />
In monochrome, we walk the hue,<br />
A puzzle clear when seen through blue.<br />
So scan the night, find what's concealed,<br />
In shadowed depths, the answer is revealed.<br />
<br />
The flag is in the format HXN{Flag}.<br />
Enter the entire flag to validate the challenge. <br />
