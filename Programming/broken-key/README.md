# Broken Key
Dear I.T. Department, <br />
I was transferring my keys to a secure environment and something went wrong. 2 characters of my RSA private key (base64) were replaced by _ somehow. <br />
Please help me figure out the key and decrypt the text given in the file. All I remember is that the contents were in the format HXN{Flag}.<br />
Enter the entire flag to validate the challenge.
