# The Poet
Start at the left, where your journey begins, <br/>
Move right through the lines, where order spins.<br/>
When you reach the end, don not stop your pace,<br/>
Descend down below, but left to right you will trace.<br/>
<br/>
For black is on, where life flickers bright,<br/>
White is the void, the absence of light.<br/>
Yet blue has a demand, it asks for some space,<br/>
A gap in the grid, a pause in the race.<br/>
<br/>
Each row you follow leads you through,<br/>
Down to the next, and rightward too.<br/>
The path is a dance of colors and rows,<br/>
With secrets revealed as your progress flows.<br/>
<br/>
But will you break the code that has spun?<br/>
In this woven maze, your quest has just begun.<br/>
