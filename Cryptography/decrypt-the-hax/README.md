# Decrypt the Hax
Welcome to Decrypt the Hax, where only the sharpest hackers thrive. <br>
Navigate through codes to reveal the flags. <br>
Each stanza of the poem serves as a clue guiding you to victory. <br>
The flag is in the format HXN{Flag}. <br>
Enter the entire flag to validate the challenge. <br>
Can you unlock the secrets and claim your prize?<br>
<br>
In Haxnation, where hackers rise,<br>
Through firewalls thick and countless tries,<br>
The final breach comes into view,<br>
As we unlock at sixty-two.<br>
<br>
The network bends, the code is cracked,<br>
A thousand skills, we don’t look back.<br>
With rooted hosts, we break the core,<br>
The system yields at sixty-four.<br>
<br>
Exploits run wild, the bots we drive,<br>
With scripts deployed, no need to strive.<br>
The flag revealed at last, we dive,<br>
We claim our win at forty-five.<br>
<br>
Through tangled code, we brute and fight,<br>
A hidden vuln in plain sight.<br>
Persistence pays—don't hesitate,<br>
The server falls at fifty-eight.<br>
<br>
Within the void, dark webs align,<br>
Our shell connects, we cross the line.<br>
We break the chains and pass right through,<br>
Haxnation wins at ninety-two.<br>
<br>
The challenge grows, the data’s deep,<br>
We never rest, we never sleep.<br>
One line of code makes all things new,<br>
We push the key at thirty-two.<br>
<br>
The final task, the ultimate test, <br>
Among the best, we hack with zest.<br>
The capture’s ours, we feel alive,<br>
The gates are cracked at eighty-five.
