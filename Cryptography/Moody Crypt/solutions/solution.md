In the python script all the characters are modded with 97.
There are 125 maximum possible values for a character.
There are two possible cases:
* 97 < The character < 125.
This states that, when modded, the character would be lesser than 28.
* The character < 97. Which means the modded characters here remains the same. <br/><br/>
