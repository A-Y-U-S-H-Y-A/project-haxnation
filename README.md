# Project Haxnation
Project Haxnation is an initative by Ayushya Shah to create the largest open source repository of CTF challenges for security enthusiats to practice and learn various concepts in and around various pillars of cybersecurity.
## Motivation
Various CTF providers, provide none or some challenges to users for free. This often limits the growth of people to only a few scenarios.
Often times the code of the challenges are also not provided, thus not allowing developers in security to understand, modify and analyse the code.
Project Haxnation aims to cover the gaps mentioned above along with being protected under the GNU GPL v3.
## How to use
- Choose the folder of the domain you are interested in
- Choose the challenge
- Read the Readme.md file inside of it to set up the challenge and understand the rules
